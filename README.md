# Project
This is the very basic project where i create my own webServer and webBrowser in order to send data from client to server by using various 
Input Output classes and also using socket class and serverSocket class and whenever every new request is arrive at server end then in that case 
processing of that request is done on new thread so i use some basic comcept of multithreading too.

The next version of this project might include RMI where there is no need of using input output classes and instead of using this i can 
use bind() method and lookup() method for the client server connectivity.
